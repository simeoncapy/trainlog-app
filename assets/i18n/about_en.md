# What is Trainlog?

Trainlog is a online service to keep track of your travel. See all your train, bus, ferry, and airplane journeys neatly on a map. See a statistical breakdown of how, when, and where have you travelled. Get useful statistics on your most frequently visited stations, most frequently used operators, and how much of your country's railway network have you been on.

You can also create shareable links about your trips to share your travel plans with anyone, and compare yourself with the Trainlog community.

# How it works?

* All the data used are from [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
* Stations search is provided by [Photon](https://photon.komoot.io/).
* Paths :
  * Train and ferry paths are created using a modified version of the [OSRM](https://project-osrm.org/).
  * Bus paths are stock OSRM routes.
  * Air paths are simply a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic) between arrival and departure
* All maps are displayed on the website using the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library
* Languages other than English, French, Dutch and Japanese are largely machine-generated, feel free to report inaccuracies in the Discord with the link at the bottom of this page
